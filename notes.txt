==============
# Ansible
==============
- Take k8s manifests out of all ansible files folders and put them in seperate git repo (like docker-compose files)
- kubernetes.core (& other?) modules has to be installed before using it in playbook.
    --> For now manual install, future think of seperate ansible config playbook?
- Install ansible on master machine 
    --> put agent on raspberry pi
- traefik keeps installing when running k3s playbook
    --> Install triggerd by cert-manager???


==============
# k3s
==============
- Install k3s first, run everything (homer, portainer, jenkins...) from there with helm
- Add remote dashboard w/ ingress??
- Fix kubeconfig so I don't hav to export it everytime

==============
# certmanager
==============
- Check nginx ansible cert automation with YQ. Somehow not supporting env-vars

==============
# nextcloud
==============
- check hostname config in helm values if problems occur
